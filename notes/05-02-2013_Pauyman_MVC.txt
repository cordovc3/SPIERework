MVC with Paymuan 

[charles note: not sure exactly how to structure this but this is my best guess.]

Ingeniux: Flat File XML
	XSLS transformations
	
Global Routes: Global.asax
	yep nope
	LESS - CSS preprocessor
	
// used so that ssl cet warnings wont show  up
	also important for FF aurora
	int? is a nullable int
	
* - wildcard in routing
browsers - 6 concurrent connections [chazz note: i don't know what this means]

merged and minified CSS and JS using bunding system
	global.asax:appstart
	
Style bundle (~/css/shared) = inclue all dirs [c note: I think we need a bit more here? I thought it was ("~/css/shared", "*.css") for example?]
	render it wtih @razor
	
iTransform + JSmin + CSSmin

site control:
	build model and render page
	*STRONGLY TYPE*

Magic strings - Dynamic object (like viewbag)
	Late binding:
		@model dynamic
		since you don't know if it is cms or not, change up infor with dynamic razor

build model - OVERRIDE ME
	int? debug = nullable int
	
	call base.load()
	MVVM to build a view model
	LC - left centered [?]
	
	layouts: "~/views/shared/_________
	 ^^^ lets you choose page layouts
	 
	nav class (in models)
	
enum.parse

helpsers: Write to response stream
add @helper and @functions

@sections  script  \___________bundle
	   style   /           bundle
	   meta
